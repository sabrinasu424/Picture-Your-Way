#### Abstract
The main purpose of this study is to build a picture-based attraction recommendation system. The proposed algorithm combines Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and K-Means in the structure of Scatter/Gather. Through this system, thousands of tourist attractions in Taiwan are recommended to users via a direct and prompt process, picking pictures. This study uses information on attractions listed in an open data and selects corresponding pictures from Instagram. The pictures ranked by Elo Rating System is moderately correlated to the
realistic preference of people. The accuracy of LDA topics is 66%. The precision value for this proposed algorithm is 74%. And the system effectiveness calculated through the feedback of users is PR 72. Therefore, this system is proven to succeed in recommending suitable and beautiful attractions in Taiwan to users by using the proposed algorithm
in this study.
